<Summary
	title="Liquidity for locked tokens"
	text="Harbor Protocol transforms illiquid vested tokens into tradable assets through algorithmic market making on Uniswap V4. DAO treasury managers at mid-to-large protocols can now liquidate locked tokens at 8-12% discounts instead of losing 25-45% through traditional OTC deals. By standardizing maturities and concentrating liquidity, we deliver transparent, on-demand pricing that makes bond issuance finally attractive for protocol treasuries."
