    "prompt": "A medium-wide environmental portrait of a professional in their early 30s, standing off-center in a minimalist, modern office with concrete and glass architectural features. The subject is dressed in smart-casual attire, displaying a focused, contemplative expression as they thoughtfully engage with their environment. Cool daylight streams in through large windows, casting soft, diffused light and subtle blue-gray tones across the scene. The composition uses generous negative space and a slight matte finish, with lifted blacks and cool, desaturated colors. There are no tech devices, screens, text, or abstract elements presentâ€”only real objects and people. The overall mood is one of composed confidence and intellectual engagement, suggesting a decisive moment in a credible governance context.",

    "prompt": "A sophisticated professional in their early 30s sits alone in a modern office with concrete and glass architectural elements, bathed in cool natural daylight from large windows. The subject, dressed in smart-casual attire, is deeply focused, leaning slightly forward with a thoughtful expression, hand near chin, gazing toward an unseen object out of frame. The environment is organized and minimalist, with muted blue-gray tones and subtle purple shadows, generous negative space, and a clean, editorial-style composition. No visible technology, screens, or text. The mood is composed, confident, and intentional, suggesting an important decision moment.",
